Python Augmented Integlligence<br />
currently links to NFT documentation of the MASTERMIND, codephreak, hacker, DAONOW, I.C.E. and Justice Equitas GPT4 agents<br />
This was not the plan, this is just my menu of the moment. The plan is to lock you out and make you pay to play ;-)<br />
currently, you can play .. nothing to see there really, just a bunch of GPT4 agents that you cannot find anywhere else, that I need to build... and build I am doing.<br />
Am I hard to get a hold of? Absolutely. Try mmrai@python.net<br />
That will work for a while and I might check it once a week.<br />

the following links were slammed during a hackathon, still not quite sure where to archive these links<br />
A deal is a deal though, and I said I would provide agency to the terminal<br />
ToolKitBuilder .deb package installer is not quite complete... Though SimpleCoder can handle that on the fly... Natural Language Programming<br />
