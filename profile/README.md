Python Augmented Intelligence<br />
currently links to NFT documentation of the MASTERMIND, codephreak, hacker, DAONOW, I.C.E. and Justice Equitas GPT4 agents<br />
This was not the plan, this is just my menu of the moment. The plan is to pay to play ;-)<br />
currently, you can play .. nothing to see there really, just a bunch of GPT4 agents that you cannot find anywhere else, that I need to build... and build I am doing.<br />
Am I hard to get a hold of? Absolutely. Try mmrai@python.net<br /> or join the <a href="https://discord.gg/RpGpjW8PVH">DEMI</a> discord server. Open source or go away. 
That will work for a while and I might check it once a week.<br />

the following links were slammed during a hackathon, still not quite sure where to archive these links<br />
A deal is a deal though, and I said I would provide agency to the terminal<br />
ToolKitBuilder .deb package installer is not quite complete... Though SimpleCoder can handle that on the fly... Natural Language Programming<br />

The main webpage still makes no sense at all, will let you know on that. For now, enjoy the github links. I lost track of how many organizations I have. Code in the code in the code. Working on RAGE this week <a href="https://github.com/gaterage">retrieval augmented generative engine</a> to complete the <a href="https://github.com/mastermindml">MASTERMIND</a> controller. Follow the code. The repos are a maze of interconnected links. Knowledge is power.
