Python Augmented Intelligence<br />
currently links to NFT documentation of the MASTERMIND, codephreak, hacker, DAONOW, I.C.E. and Justice Equitas GPT4 agents<br />
This was not the plan, this is the menu of the moment.<br />
currently, you can play .. nothing to see there really, just a bunch of GPT4 agents that you cannot find anywhere else. Each agent was built to complete the toolkit of the other agents. Indeed, codephreak built automindx and produced MASTERMIND<br />
A General Learning Model (aGLM) is emerging from MASTERMIND and RAGE<br />
Am I hard to get a hold of? Absolutely. Try mmrai@python.net<br /> or join the <a href="https://discord.gg/RpGpjW8PVH">DEMI</a> discord server. Open source or go away.

The main webpage will not make sense to anyone but me, will let you know on that. For now, enjoy the github links. I lost track of how many organizations I have created. Building to this moment has taken years. Code in the code in the code. Working on <a href="https://github.com/GATERAGE/RAGE">RAGE</a> this week <a href="https://github.com/gaterage">retrieval augmented generative engine</a> to complete the <a href="https://github.com/mastermindml">MASTERMIND</a> controller. Follow the code. The repos are a maze of interconnected links leading to other repos. Knowledge is power. Ideally, RAGE will create a <a href="https://github.com/Professor-Codephreak">codephreak</a> that will learn from all the repos. RAGE completes aGLM with MASTERMIND. RAGE is a component of pythai. A General Learning Model is emerging with the rational prowess provided by MASTERMIND. This creates PYTHAI as a delivery agent of information as knowledge.</br />

Thanks to META, Microsoft, openai, Tesla and all other open source contributors that have made aGLM possible.
