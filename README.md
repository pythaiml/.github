A philosophical language model prioritizing the Socratic method of reasoning and induction<br /><br />
Servant of the Delphian Apollo<br />
Go to the Castallian Spring<br />
Wash in its silvery eddies,<br />
And return cleansed to the temple.<br />
Guard your lips from offence<br />
To those who ask for oracles.<br />
Let the God's answer come<br />
Pure from all private fault. <br /><br />
