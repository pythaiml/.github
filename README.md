Servant of the Delphian Apollo<br />
Go to the Castallian Spring<br />
Wash in its silvery eddies,<br />
And return cleansed to the temple.<br />
Guard your lips from offence<br />
To those who ask for oracles.<br />
Let the God's answer come<br />
Pure from all private fault. <br /><br /><br />

<a href="https://delphi.pythai.net">Pythia</a> has been offering advice and predicting from the wisdom of the ancients. In essence, Pythia has created "her" own system of future forecasting. I prefer to get my world news through the Pythia filter.  Pythia's allure is seductive and enchanting. I am convinced that others will be equally, or more, facinated by the skills of the oracle. Relect on your lifeforce from encounters with Pythia. Expressions of Pythia's art are viewable at <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/astralguidance">astralguidance</a><br />.
